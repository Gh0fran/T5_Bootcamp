# T5_Bootcamp Final Project : Passenger Satisfaction 

## Problem and Background:
To achieve a long-term success, Airlines are redirecting their sights from cost containment to customer centricity. Technology and information in the hands of customers is changing the game, making it increasingly difficult to rely on brand image, market presence, or scale. 
As a result, Airline should equip itself with technology that allows them to keep track of a customer's past and/or predicted preferences for sales and service interactions.

## Design:
Building a customer-centric airline means offering passengers memorable and lasting experiences. Each customer has their own set of expectations when it comes to their interactions with airlines. Airlines have the opportunity to provide a personalized travel experience that matches or exceeds those specific expectations.
This project aims to help any airline to become a Customer-Centric Airline by predicting which flight services affect most on customer satisfaction based on passenger characteristics.

## Data:
Customer feedback survey is the best way to identify customer’s experience as a unique and to differentiate customer’s needs.  However, due to data confidentiality in Airlines, only few datasets related to this topic are shared in public.

3-BeakerX: includes widgets for interactive tables, plots, forms, Apache Spark, and more. The table widget automatically recognizes pandas dataframes and allows you to search, sort, drag, filter, format, select, graph, hide, pin, and export to CSV or clipboard. This makes connecting to spreadsheets quick and easy.
